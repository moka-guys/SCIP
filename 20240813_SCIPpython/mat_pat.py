# function which reads 'AS' 'AC' etc and separates into different alleles
# discards A's
# makes up SNP table of alleles we have to care about
# maternal gt necessary, paternal optional
# what if gts not fully known?

# csv with maternal gt / paternal gt / also columns for file names?

# one function to read in file and assign to variables too. 
# hey thats probably a class

# input is 2 variables - the mat_gt variable and the pat_gt variable. 
# variables should be strings or empty
# need to split strings into component parts. 
# and then ... do stuff. Save strings in list? or set variables to 
# true or false?
